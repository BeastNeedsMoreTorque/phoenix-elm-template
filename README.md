# Phoenix, Elm 0.19, and Parcel Template

This is a starter repo for Phoenix/Elm projects with Parcel. 
Startup should work the same as a standard Phoenix project:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
Changes to your `.elm` files under `assets/src` should be picked up in development
and reloaded on the fly. 

Happy coding!
